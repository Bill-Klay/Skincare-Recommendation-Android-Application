7020,334,C,4,"This review will compare this aloe vera gel to the leave on primer by nuface for use with the microcurrent device. I have been using nuface for a few months now. I have generally used it with the 'official' primer. Aloe vera gel is a great go-to option. I have used it with this gel a handful of times and I can state what I have noticed. Firstly, it requires a bit more product than the other gel because this aloe vera gel starts to 'dry' faster so a thicker layer is required so that it continues to 'glide.¬†Secondly, I noticed that this aloe vera moisturising gel is 98% aloe vera. In the past I have only used 99% formulations (for aftercare for laser, etc.) While I will say there is not much of a difference; this product tends to be less 'sticky' when applied in a thick layer and from what I have experienced, does not start to make thos white flakes, etc. In my opinion, this makes it better to use on the face in general. It can act as a product on the face on its own to some extent as it is 'moisturising' and hasnt 'dried up' in my experience. I will note that I have only ever left this on for 10 - 20 minutes so I don't know what happens afterwards but I doubt it will flake. Importantly, I cannot comment on how effectively it conducts the electric current from the device. I can say however, that I am confident enough in it personally to rely on this gel a few times a week to make my nuface gel go further as I do believe it is likely a comparable conductor. This is just my opinion, however. (I am a scientist, but I am not a physicist so I would not like to claim to know more than I truly do, particularly about a fairly new technology like these at-home devices.) :)¬†Third. In terms of the packaging, it is fine and almost the same as the nuface gel in terms of how much product comes out with a squeeze. Although one is not travelling as much nowadays, I will note that my nuface gel in the smallest bottle was 59ml. (Back in early 2020 - pre-march) I was able to carry this in my hand luggage without a problem even though the limit is usually 50ml. Maybe I was just fortunate - both ways. But the point I make is that it is a smaller more travel easy bottle. Regarding the aloe vera gel, while the bottle is definitely not large (only a but bigger honestly), the volume of tis written in grams and ounces. So from a quick search that seems to be. 118ml (And looks right.) So it's not a carry on size necessarily but it is small enough for a journey where you can check your luggage, train, etc. For sure. Additionally, the tube has a matte finish. Its a pleasant tube and is just as shown.Finally, I will mention it doesnt get as 'tight' as some aloe ver gels. I spot tested this in order to write this review. It does end up with an ever so slightly tacky feeling. But i feel like this is a bit less than other, organic, aloe vera gels I have tired in the past. All in all it is a good product but seeing as I bought it for a specific reason I thought I might write this review based on the use I purchased it for. In my opinion I will continue to alternate between the original gel and this nice Aloe vera gel. Even using a greater amount of product, it works out a lot more financially expedient than the original Nuface gel which costs a lot more per ml.¬†Hope I helped someone!

And at night it gives it time to properly sink in to your skin. I think this product would be brilliant for you if you have really dry skin. But if you are like myself with normal skin type I find that it is a little too heavy. I have actually bought Weleda Skin Food Light and it has worked much better for me. It is easier to apply and you can wear it as a day time moisturiser. "

In the Am I apply just to dry skin, I don't wash my face, then sunscreen over the top. In the PM during the summer I apply to damp skin after cleansing and in winter I apply hyaluronic acid to damp skin, then this over the top, just to give some extra hydration.†It's pricey for the amount you get, so I recommend buying in bulk when there's sales on.†Truly a great moisturiser."

I'm sensitive to aloe vera, as well.Good points: very light texture, doesn't leave greesy feeling, although slightly sticky to start with but absorbs quickly. My skin didn't break out.Now, coming to the rest. The dropper applicator - it's not very good, not easy to get the last drops out of the bottle, wouldn't call it very hygienic also, I think pump would be more suitable for this type of product. It's not economical either, it took me about 2 months! to use it all. I haven't noticed extra hydration and my lines haven't changed.

8036,#N/A,Robin,5,"I've never before felt compelled to review a product, but this serum has had magical effects on my combination/extremely sensitive/couperose-prone skin. I received a sample size (10ml, which is a nice amount) with a previous order on Lookfantastic, and I started using it during a time of utter desperation (I'm being dramatic!), as my skin was acting out and making me unhappy. I loved it so much that I just HAD to buy the full size bottle.I'm probably a bit younger than the target demographic for the ""Keep Young and Beautiful"" series of products, but, while I don't drink or smoke or abuse my skin in any significant way, I do work from 9AM to 11PM, 5 days a week, in front of a computer screen, getting basically no sun or air, which leads to a tired, washed out-looking skin.The Instant Firming Beauty Shot promises to ""lift and plump up the skin, increase elasticity and fight the visible signs of ageing,"" and that's precisely what it does (well, not sure about the ""fighting the signs of ageing"" bit yet, but you get the point). As soon as it's been applied, the skin feels (and looks) nice and taut, but not in an unpleasant way! Quite the opposite. I generally apply it after I spritzed (is that a word? English isn't my first language, I apologize!) a floral water, while the skin is still ""wet,"" and I find both the application and result just lovely. But what's truly remarkable for me is the effect the serum has on my couperose.

I received a sample size (10ml, which is a nice amount) with a previous order on Lookfantastic, and I started using it during a time of utter desperation (I'm being dramatic!), as my skin was acting out and making me unhappy. I loved it so much that I just HAD to buy the full size bottle.I'm probably a bit younger than the target demographic for the ""Keep Young and Beautiful"" series of products, but, while I don't drink or smoke or abuse my skin in any significant way, I do work from 9AM to 11PM, 5 days a week, in front of a computer screen, getting basically no sun or air, which leads to a tired, washed out-looking skin.The Instant Firming Beauty Shot promises to ""lift and plump up the skin, increase elasticity and fight the visible signs of ageing,"" and that's precisely what it does (well, not sure about the ""fighting the signs of ageing"" bit yet, but you get the point). As soon as it's been applied, the skin feels (and looks) nice and taut, but not in an unpleasant way! Quite the opposite. I generally apply it after I spritzed (is that a word? English isn't my first language, I apologize!) a floral water, while the skin is still ""wet,"" and I find both the application and result just lovely. But what's truly remarkable for me is the effect the serum has on my couperose. I have no idea which of its ingredients (or combination of them) is responsible for it, BUT THANK YOU, DEAR SIR. The redness is much less noticeable to the eye now, while the tiny bumps (similar to ""chicken skin"") have almost entirely disappeared.

8249,584,Bob,3,"Quick overview of me, I have very sensitive skin and am extremely pale. For me any fake tan with DHA causes an itchy red rash that can be very uncomfortable. This product certainly doesn't do that. Following the instructions on the bottle it does take a long time to build up colour. I initially started using a few drops in my moisturiser to build up colour. As a newbie tanner I did not want the awful orange look. If you do this method you won't see results. Very quickly I realised you need to moisturise before, let it dry and then put the tanning oil on. If you use this method it takes about 3 days of constant use (putting on every night and sleeping in it) to see colour. By the third day I did have a lovely natural glow. It isn't a dark tan like normal tanning products but rather a sun kissed, day at the beach glow which is what I was aiming for. You do need more than you think, I would say a good 6/7 drops on each arm, leg and main body.The downside to the product is the fact that the oil is not fast absorbing. It takes a LONG time to soak into the skin and you need to wear clothes to bed that you don't mind it rubbing off on. The first time I applied the oil for 3 days it started to rub off on my white bed sheets. Once you've applied it, you need to give yourself a good 30 minutes if not longer to allow it to try and soak into the skin before dressing. Even then you will feel it moving on your on skin and onto your clothes. Saying that it still produced a nice colour.The tan starts to naturally fade after about 3/4 days. If you don't scrub in the shower or with a towel and only pat dry then the tan doesn't move or cause any patches. Also moisturising after each shower really helps this tan maintain its colour. The only other frustration with this product is how easily it comes off on a sports bra and socks. If you're someone like me who works out often then this might be a deciding factor. I started to notice after only the second day of having the tan that It had worn off and left patches where my sports bra would be and around the ankle area where my socks would be. This causes a big contrast in colour and can be quite noticeable with sandals or a low cut top on. Just something to consider. Overall if you have super sensitive skin like me and want something to give you a glow throughout the summer months then this is the product for you. Just be mindful of the lengthy application process and when you're sweaty it could rub off. ",0,1,1,0,1,,,,,"Quick overview of me, I have very sensitive skin and am extremely pale.

I bought this full size as I loved it so much and as both myself and my daughter are eczema sufferers so wanted it to hand to try. This is amazing, the back of my daughter's (9) hands are feeling dead, dry, rough, red, itchy and aggravated from eczema triggered by the school using hand sanitizer on her twice a day (not the one we use for more sensitive skins). I planned to call the GP tomorrow morning for a prescription, smothered Dr PawPaw over her hands, covered with sandwich bags and put socks over them. I have just taken them off 3 hours 15 mins later as she had pulled one off in her sleep and her hands feel amazing and smooth.

7603,841,Sally,4,"I purchased this mask after reading positive reviews online. It's a high-end product which looks and feels very luxurious. It comes in a pretty cardboard box - good to see recyclable packaging which is something we should all be looking for. The product itself comes in a hexagonal glass jar with a brown screw lid - in fact it looks rather like a jar of honey. It should be applied with the metal spatula provided in the box, which you can store on the lid thanks to the magnetic lid - a really clever piece of design. The mask looks just like sticky honey when applied, but massage it into your skin for a few moments and it turns into a white, creamy mask which feels warm on the skin. I found it relaxing and soothing once on. After using for the first time, my skin felt well-hydrated, smooth and bright. I have been applying this mask on average twice a week and notice an improvement in skin texture and pore size. A great product, worth the investment in my opinion. ",0,0,0,0,0,,,,,"I purchased this mask after reading positive reviews online. It's a high-end product which looks and feels very luxurious.

Slap it on, leave it for 10 minutes (my skin drinks most of it up) and then tissue off the excess. I do this before I go to bed so I can sleep on it and wash it off thoroughly in my morning skincare routine. It leaves my skin plump, even and glowing with NO irritation or breakouts.

9024,895,Hefzi,5,"This was quite a considered purchase for me, but I am really glad I took the plunge.  The peel has a light gel consistency and a citrussy scent (though this is not very noticeable) and you apply to your face and decolletage and leave for up to an hour.  It spreads really easily, without any dragging, and you don't need very much at all for a complete application, so a jar actually lasts for quite a while, using once or twice a week, as a result.  The gel seems to absorb somewhat, so when you come to wash it off, there appears to be far less product than you applied, and it washes off really easily - no need for scrubbing.  Best of all are the results - my skin looked much brighter after the first time I used it, and by using the peel regularly, I find these results have maintained really well.  I don't get any tingling when I use this product, but I use a lot of very active skin care: I suspect, if you have sensitive skin, this will probably be too strong for you to leave on for very long.

But I think it would work a lot better for more mature skins who have problems with daily puffiness, fine lines and wrinkles.This is a good product but it's expensive, and for young skins with only dark shadows to deal with, it's not worth it's price tag. For such people there's a free remedy that beats this gooey pink cream hands-down: good old sleep!"

It does its job well either way, even heavy eye makeup can be removed easily  and I did not have to scrub my eyes to much.  It smells pleasant too.  It removed my makeup gently but often times it made my skin feel a little oily after i washed with water, also I had to use a significant amount of product to remove 100% of my makeup, which are minus points.

The Glow L'oreal scrub has bigger sugar grains whereas the grains in this Nourish scrub are finer but still do a great job at removing dry skin. Leaves your skin feeling lovely and soft to touch :) I didn't have to use much to cover my whole face either so this jar should last awhile. Unless I'm imagining it, my skin looks a little 'brighter' since using this which is always a plus!If you have dry, sensitive skin like mine, this is worth a try. I recommend this product and would definitely re-purchase"

The oil does create some bubbles, and it doesn't sit on top of the water like some other oils I've tried. It left my skin soft and fragranced throughout the evening and I felt relaxed and extravagant.†I'll definitely be buying again, but this bottle will last ages so I'll probably get another Black Friday deal"

10347,1434,Christmasbather,5,"After receiving a time freebie with a store bundle a while ago, I have been hankering after some Aromatherapy Associates bath and shower oil for a while. The scent cocktails are truly amazing.You won't be disappointed with this one its just what I needed. I do practice mindfulness in the bath for 'me time' and these oils really make it a spa like experience. After working late till 3am and up for clients at 9am I really wanted a booster. Having received this through the door this morning, I made time to test it out. It was so beautiful. A bath on a cold winter's morning with this fresh and deeply comforting oil was dreamy. This is definitely a day or morning smell.I found that pouring in the recommended capful provides a strongly scented bath time experience and when poured under the hot water it releases lots of scent. The stream rising from the bath was heavenly.  Its very cheery as well as fortifying. With green freshness as well as some citrus it really wakes up the senses. I used it with some small amounts of pure almond oil and vitamin E oil in the bath for my skin and it was very soft afterwards.Totally indulgent. I really think if you wanted to you could be frugal with it and use perhaps half to 3/4 of a capful to get even more than the recommended 20 capfuls from it. It was nice to also see a clean bath, no lingering oily residue and it seems to be a pure product with high quality oils. Also worth mentioning is the packaging. The glass bottle and the box it arrives in is also stunning. It would make a gorgeous present and looks lovely in the bathroom. Highly recommended this may become a little addictive! Buy it you'll love it. I have ordered two alternatives from the range to also try, more for relaxation in the evening, I was that impressed with it.",0,0,0,1,0,,,,,"After receiving a time freebie with a store bundle a while ago, I have been hankering after some Aromatherapy Associates bath and shower oil for a while.
